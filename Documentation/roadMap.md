# Requirements Specification

This document outlines the tasks and milestones necessary to complete the imlementation of alugAE. Each task ensures that the requirements are well-defined and documented before proceeding to the subsequent development stages.

## 1. Project Overview

### Tasks
- [ ] Define the project's main objective and goals.
  - Key objectives: Provide a web-based system for managing media collections and user interactions.
- [ ] Identify the stakeholders and their primary concerns.

## 2. Actors and User Stories

### Tasks
- [ ] Define all system actors and their roles.
  - Key actors: User, Visitor, Reader, Owner, Administrator.
- [ ] Document user stories for each actor.
- [ ] Supplement user stories with business rules:

## 3. Information Architecture

### Tasks
- [ ] Develop a sitemap to represent the relationship between all planned pages.
- [ ] Create wireframes for critical pages.

## 4. Technical Requirements

### Tasks
- [ ] Specify technical constraints and requirements.
  - Adaptive design for multi-device compatibility.
  - Integration with external systems (e.g., OAuth for authentication).
- [ ] Define security and data handling protocols.

## 5. Documentation and Review

### Tasks
- [ ] Consolidate all artifacts into a single document.
  - Include project overview, user stories, architecture, and technical requirements.
- [ ] Conduct a review with stakeholders to validate requirements.
- [ ] Incorporate feedback and finalize the specification document.

## Milestones
1. Initial draft of project goals and actors: **[Deadline TBD]**
2. Completion of user stories and business rules: **[Deadline TBD]**
3. Approval of sitemap and wireframes: **[Deadline TBD]**
4. Finalization of requirements specification: **[Deadline TBD]**

# Database Specification 

This document outlines the tasks and milestones necessary to complete the Database Specification (EBD) phase for the MediaLibrary system. This phase ensures the data model, relational schema, and database implementation are thoroughly planned and validated.

## 1. Conceptual Data Model

### Tasks
- [ ] Define entities and relationships using a UML class diagram.
- [ ] Document business rules not captured in the UML diagram:


## 2. Relational Schema

### Tasks
- [ ] Convert the conceptual model to a relational schema.
  - Define tables, attributes, domains, primary keys, and foreign keys.
- [ ] Apply normalization to ensure the schema is in BCNF.
  - Validate functional dependencies.
- [ ] Specify additional integrity constraints:
- [ ] Validate the relational schema using sample data.

## 3. Physical Schema and Performance Optimization

### Tasks
- [ ] Identify indexes to optimize query performance.
- [ ] Develop triggers to enforce data integrity rules.
- [ ] Define database transactions and isolation levels to handle concurrency.
- [ ] Create SQL scripts for database creation and population.


## 4. Documentation and Review

### Tasks
- [ ] Consolidate all artifacts into a single database specification document.
- [ ] Incorporate feedback and finalize the database specification document.

## Milestones
1. Completion of the conceptual data model: **[Deadline TBD]**
2. Approval of the relational schema: **[Deadline TBD]**
3. Validation of SQL scripts and database population: **[Deadline TBD]**
4. Finalization of the database specification: **[Deadline TBD]**
